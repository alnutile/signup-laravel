# Laravel 4 Registration Template

Basic sign up / registraion template. Not done yet.

What is nice about this install is the use of codecept to do the acceptance tests. You can find those in app/tests/acceptance

This is my first attempt at Laravel, I really like it.

There is also script to dump and reseed the db before it runds the tests.
runtest.sh

Though at some point I was hoping to get guard working with codecept tests.
